# cncjs_controlls
This is not an extension or a mod. Just a copy of the controlls any one can edit from within the program, but mine is populated for cnc work. 

## Why do you want this too?
What this offers you is a shortcut to a bunch of work I have done to setup my interface. 
In theory a person could have several of these files each with a unique configuration.

## What is the point?
It took me time to come up with a working controll pannel that existed with the CNCjs widgets. 
This will effect Marlin - CNC users the best. 

## Why is the file in a zip folder?
If I don't do this then the file might become hidden.
Zip insures you can access and download as intended. 

## How to use this?
It goes in the root level of your user directory in windows, for now.  
Sorry, some one will need to inform me where it lives on other systems. 

## Am I affiliated with CNCjs?
No. I am a user. I was a sponsor for over a year. But after development stopped, and I no longer recognized the last active listed developer, I stopped sponsoring.
No. None of the code belongs to me.

## Are you distributing code outside of licence? 
I dont belive so, this is a document that is generated by the compiled program. 
My vantage this would be like Microsoft getting angry when an excel file is shared. 
No raw code is part of this. No compiled code is part of this.
