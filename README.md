# cncjs_controlls
This is not an extension or a mod. Just a copy of the controlls any one can edit from within the program, but mine is populated for cnc work. 

## Why do you want this too?
What this offers you is a shortcut to a bunch of work I have done to setup my interface. 
In theory a person could have several of these files each witha unique configuration.
